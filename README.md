# Silverwing Solace Guild

---

## Aim of the site.

Silverwing Solace is a guild in the MMORPG World of Warcraft, based on a fantasy world where millions of people play together every week, competing between each other or in group contents.
The guild has an active base of around 40 members playing at different times and days, getting together on specific days to either organise social events or groups events against NPC (Non-Player-Character, computer control characters).
The guild requested to have a website created where they can show their progression within the game, and a place where new recruits can look for information and ranks.

---
## UX
* The visitors can read about what the guild is about and where to find them.
* The visitors can see the past events and the photos from them.
* The visitors see a gallery of members / evans pictures.
* Role page where visitors can read about different roles and a google map where they can see the location in the World of those members.
In order to achieve this, the client wanted a website which meets the following criteria:
1. A main page where the recruitment / mantra of the guild.
2. A page dedicated for social upcoming events and past events, where a flyer style drop down menu would reveal either the flyer for the upcoming and the photo for the past events.
3. Apage where pictures taken by members can be seen by the visitors.
4. A page where there are the 3 different class roles and a list with the members in the guild and their location in the World.

## Testing
Initially I was using the developers tools from Google Chrome to make sure the colors and the code was the correct one, making sure the project looked good on mobile devices first and built up from there.
I also used the tools below:
* [Unicorn Revealer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) to help to locate the overflow and position of the different containers.
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the markup validity of the HTML.
* [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS file.
* [JShint Javascript validator](https://jshint.com/) to validate Javascript files.
* [JSONLint JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate the JSON variable within the javascript file.

1920 x 937<br>
3591 x 937<br>
414 x 736<br>
768 x 1024<br>

Finally i tested in different browser:
* Google Chrome Version 84.0.4147.89 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Firefox Version 78.0.2 (64-bit)
* Microsoft Edge Version 44.18362.449.0
* Opera Version 68.0.3618.46

### Issues and resolutions
* When running some of the jquery scripts where giving me errors like the "getJSON" command would come back as not a command.
I fixed the problem by loading the google full script instead of https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com scripts.

* When I created the list of members, there were 50 members so the list was too long. For building purposes I reduce the list to 10 members and loaded on the js file as a variable.

* On creating the events page from the template, the background images will only cover the middle.
I found 2 solutions as the image is big enough I could place it on the first div at the edge and it will cover the whole page. Second option which i went for, i place the same image in the 3 column and kept the opacity on the sides one so give a 3D sensation of the page.
 
On my half-way point I discussed with my mentor several issues:
The completion of README.md wireframes,
The introduction of a role filter in the google map API
The format of the html and the js file.
I also made a list with tasks to be completed.
